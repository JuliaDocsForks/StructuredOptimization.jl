# StructuredOptimization.jl

Convex and nonconvex regularized least squares in Julia.

## Installation

From the Julia command line hit `Pkg.clone("https://github.com/nantonel/StructuredOptimization.jl.git")`.
Once the package is installed you can update it along with the others issuing
`Pkg.update()` in the command line.

## Usage

With StructuredOptimization.jl you can solve problems of the form

```
minimize (1/2)*||L(x) - b||^2 + g(x)
```

Here `L` is a linear operator, `b` is an `Array` of data, and `g` is a regularization
taken from [ProximalOperators.jl](https://github.com/kul-forbes/ProximalOperators.jl).
You can use any `AbstractMatrix` object to describe `L`, or any matrix-like object
implementing the matrix-vector product and transpose operations
(see for example [LinearOperators.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/LinearOperators.jl)).
Alternatively, you can provide the direct and adjoint mappings in the form of `Function` objects.

```julia
x, info = solve(L, b, g) # L is a matrix-like object
x, info = solve(Op, OpAdj, b, g, x0) # Op and OpAdj are of type Function
```

The dimensions of `b` must match the ones of `L` or `Op` and `OpAdj`.
Argument `x0` (the initial iterate for the algorithm) is compulsory when
mappings `Op` and `OpAdj` are provided.

## Example: sparse signal reconstruction

Consider the problem of recovering a sparse signal, observed through a measurement
matrix `A` which is orthogonal. A random instance of such problem is generated as
follows, where measurements are affected by Gaussian noise:

```julia
m, n, k = 1024, 4096, 160 # problem parameters
B = randn(m, n)
Q, R = qr(B')
A = Q' # measurement matrix
x_orig = sign(randn(n))
J = randperm(n)
x_orig[J[k+1:end]] = 0 # generate sparse -1/+1 signal
sigma = 1e-2
y = A*x_orig + sigma*randn(m) # add noise to measurement
```

One way to approximately reconstruct `x_orig` is to solve an L1-regularized
least squares problem using the `NormL0` function, as in the following snippet
(parameters here are taken from [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4407767)):

```julia
using StructuredOptimization
using ProximalOperators
lambda_max = norm(A'*y, Inf)
lambda = 0.01*lambda_max # regularization parameter
x_L1, info = solve(A, y, normL1(lambda), zeros(n))
```

Alternatively, one can use the `indBallL0` regularizer to look for the best
approximation with a given number of nonzero coefficients:

```julia
x_L0c, info = solve(A, y, indBallL0(200), zeros(n))
```
