## TODO list

* Document regularizers.
* Implement tests on regularizers.
* Give some structure to algorithms output, such as

		x, output = solve(A, b, g, x0)
where x containts the solution Array, output contains other details about the solution process.
* Link [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) to repo (once public)
* Link [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) to repo (once public)

## Regularizers to add

* Indicator of an affine subspace.
* Nuclear norm.
